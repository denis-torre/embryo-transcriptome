# Isoform-resolved transcriptome of the human preimplantation embryo

## Overview
This repository contains the analysis code and publicly available data resource for the manuscript **Isoform-resolved transcriptome reveals thousands of novel genes in human preimplantation embryos**, which is currently under revision. The page will be updated with additional information upon acceptance of the manuscript.

## Contents
The repository contains the following two major sections:
- **[Analysis pipeline code](analysis-pipeline/)**, which contains the R and Pyton code used to process the short- and long-read RNA-Seq data in order to generate the isoform-resolved transcriptome, and integrate published multi-omics datasets for orthogonal isoform validation.
- **[Data resource](https://denis-torre.github.io/embryo-transcriptome/)**, which contains links to download and explore the results of the above in a variety of formats.
